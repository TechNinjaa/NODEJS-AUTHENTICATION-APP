# NODEJS-AUTHENTICATION-APP

This Authentication System is made with NODEJS.
It Authenticates User and Direct them to Homescreen/Index page.
You can use isAuthenticated function to Protect Routes against Unauthenticated Users.
I used Passport Google OAuth2.0 to login/signup using Google.
I also used passport local to Authentication Users using classic singnup and sign in way. 
I have used MongoDB as Database to store User Schema.
